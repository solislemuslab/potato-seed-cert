# Dashboard for the WI Potato and Vegetable Growers Association

This is an online dashboard for the data analysis and data visualization of the certification database of the seed potato production.

# Usage

`Potato-Seed-Dashboard` is browser-based (preferably Google Chrome), and thus, no installation is needed. Users simply need to click on the following link: https://potato-seed-dashboard.wid.wisc.edu/.

More details are available in the documentation: [DOCS.md](https://github.com/solislemuslab/potato-seed-cert/blob/master/DOCS.md).

More details on the folder structure can be found on the contributing file: [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/solislemuslab/potato-seed-cert/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

While we recommend the use of the dashboard via the online link, we present below the steps to run the dashboard locally.

## Steps to run this website locally
Users with strong programming skills might like to modify the existing code and run a version of the dashboard locally.

A list of packages can be found in the `requirements.txt` file and is listed below:
```
DT
DMwR2
forecast
GGally
mice
maps
plotly
readxl
shiny
shinyjs
shinythemes
shinyWidgets
shinyalert
shinyhelper
tidyverse
```

There are two ways to run the dashboard locally, and the former one is recommended.

### With RStudio

1. Clone this repository with command line:
```
git clone https://github.com/solislemuslab/potato-seed-cert
```

2. Get inside the **potato-seed-cert** folder, open `install_packages.R` with [RStudio](https://posit.co) and run the code to install the necessary packages. This step can take several minutes.

3. Get inside the **ShinyApp** folder, open `global.R`. Then there are three ways to run the dashboard:
  - Click *Run App* button.

  - Use *Command/Ctrl + Shift + Enter*. 
  
  - Run the following code in the console
    ```
    runApp('ShinyApp')
    ``` 

### With Command Line

1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/solislemuslab/potato-seed-cert
```

2. Get inside the **potato-seed-cert** folder, create and activate an R virtual environment:
```
cd potato-seed-cert
R
```

3. Install the necessary packages with
```
source("./install_packages.R")
```
This step can take several minutes. Some people might need to install `shinyjs` from RStudio.

4. Run the dashboard with
```
runApp("./ShinyApp")
```

Note that even if you installed the packages already, you need to run the installation command to load the packages before running the app.
