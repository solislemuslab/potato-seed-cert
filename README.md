# Bioinformatics Dashboard for the WI Potato and Vegetable Growers Association

This is a bioinformatics online dashboard for the data analysis and data visualization of the certification database of the seed potato production.

# Usage

`Potato-Seed-Dashboard` is browser-based (preferably Google Chrome), and thus, no installation is needed. Users simply need to click on the following link: xxxxx.

More details are available in the documentation: [DOCS.md](https://github.com/solislemuslab/potato-seed-cert/blob/master/DOCS.md).

More details on the folder structure can be found on the contributing file: [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/solislemuslab/potato-seed-cert/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

While we recommend the use of the dashboard via the online link, we present below the steps to run the dashboard locally.

## Steps to run this website locally
Users with strong programming skills might like to modify the existing code and run a version of the website locally.

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/solislemuslab/potato-seed-cert
```


2. Get inside the BioKlustering-Website folder, create and activate a python virtual environment:

```
cd potato-seed-cert
python3 -m venv virtual-env
source virtual-env/bin/activate
```
Note that Mac users could need the whole path to `python3`: `/usr/local/bin/python3`.

3. Install the necessary packages with
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
This step can take several minutes.
